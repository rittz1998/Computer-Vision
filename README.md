Compared different architectures of CNN with LeNet5 on MNIST dataset

Differnt CNN models are compared on MNIST dataset of
handwritten image to detect them. LeCunâ€™s Convolutional Neural Network architecture
(also known as LeNet-5) is implemented and considered as baseline model, and the
outcome is compared with the other 2 implementation of Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) implementation. The task is to classify an image into one of the 10 classes
addressing integer from 0 to 9.

## Summary 
1) MNIST dataset
2) Data Pre-processing
3) LeNet5 Neural Network- Base Model
4) First model comparison
5) Second model comparison
6) Model learning diagnostics - k-fold
7) Model Accuracy
